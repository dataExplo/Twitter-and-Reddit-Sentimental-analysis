Acknowledgements
This Dataset was Created with the help of my fellow teammates who passionately worked hard to gather more data with the help of the Tweepy and Reddit Apis. My Project Coordinator encouraged us to collect as much data as possible and he was the main motivation behind Implementing Sentimental Analysis on Multi-Source Social Media Platforms rather than a Single Platform Such as Twitter.
